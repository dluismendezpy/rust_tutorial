# Control Flow

This Rust program demonstrates different control flow statements in Rust programming language.

## if Expressions

The `handling_conditions()` function contains an if expression which checks if a given number is divisible by 4, 3, 2 or
none of them.

## if in a let Statement

The `handle_if_let_statement()` function uses if in a let statement to assign a value to a variable conditionally.

## Loops

The `handle_loops()` function demonstrates a loop statement which is used to perform a task repeatedly until a certain
condition is met. The function takes a maximum counter value and returns the result after doubling the counter.

The `handle_multiple_loops()` function demonstrates the use of loop labels to disambiguate between multiple nested
loops.

The `handle_while()` function shows how to use the while loop in Rust to iterate through an array.

The `handle_loop_for()` function demonstrates a for loop which iterates through a range of values in reverse order.
